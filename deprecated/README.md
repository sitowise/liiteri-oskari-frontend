Oskari 2.0
==========

Oskari 2.0 includes RequireJS, Leaflet, OpenLayers 2 and OpenLayers 3.

Migration tools and documentation are developed.

These files will change as this is work in progress. The directory structure will evolve and recently map implementations have been moved into mapping. Changes are not explicitly documented as this is experimental.
