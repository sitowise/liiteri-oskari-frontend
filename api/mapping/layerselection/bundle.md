# layerselection

Provides an UI to show which layers are currently on the map.

## Description

The bundle presents listing for currently selected maplayers. For each maplayer the user can change the opacity, hide/show the maplayer and remove it from map. 
If a maplayer is not visible in current map scale/location, the user sees a message about it and a link to move the map to location where there is content on the maplayer. 
If the layer can be published the layer has a text telling the user about it. The user can change the order of maplayers by dragging them into different order. 
Layer styles can be selected from a dropdown where applicable.
Possible layer tools (wfs grid, statslayer mode) are listed in layer containers.

## TODO

* handles wmts tooltip eventhough its not a core layer type
