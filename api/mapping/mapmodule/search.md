# Search

## Description

Creates a search field for places in published maps.

## Bundle configuration

No configuration is required. Following is optional:

The styling and font of the plugin are configurable, with variables `toolStyle` (Object) and `font` (String), respectively. A CSS class of `oskari-publisher-font-<font>` is expected to be defined with font-family definition. Following styles are supported for the `toolStyle.val`: `rounded-light`, `rounded-dark`, `sharp-dark`, `sharp-light`, `3d-dark` and `3d-light`. Images for search field background are expected to be found in plugin's image resources directory for left, middle and right sides of the field: `search-tool-<toolStyle>_01.png`, `search-tool-<toolStyle>_02.png` and `search-tool-<toolStyle>_03.png`, respectively. Also, the widths of the images are expected to be defined in config object:

```javascript
{
  val: 'rounded-dark', // The id of the style.
  widthLeft: '17px',   // Width of the left side image.
  widthRight: '32px'   // Width of the right side image.
}
```
