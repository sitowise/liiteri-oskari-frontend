# Layers Plugin

## Description

This is a plugin to bring more functionality for the mapmodules map implementation. It provides handling for rearranging layer order and controlling layer visibility. Provides information to other bundles if a layer becomes visible/invisible (out of scale/out of content geometry) and request handlers to move map to location/scale based on layer content. Also optimizes openlayers maplayers visibility setting if it detects that content is not in the viewport.

## TODO

Has some handling for the markers layer. IMHO shouldn't.

## Bundle configuration

No configuration is required.

## Bundle state

No statehandling has been implemented for this.

## Requests the bundle handles

<table class="table">
<tr>
  <th> Request </th><th> How does the bundle react</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> MapModulePlugin.MapLayerVisibilityRequest </td><td> Hides a maplayer or changes a hidden layer to visible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> MapModulePlugin.MapMoveByLayerContentRequest </td><td> Moves the map to a location and/or scale where the maplayer has content. (Maplayer geometry is visible in viewport/scale is in range for layer).</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Requests the bundle sends out

This bundle doesn't send any requests.

## Events the bundle listens to

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th> Event </th><th> How does the bundle react</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AfterRearrangeSelectedMapLayerEvent </td><td> Moves the Openlayers maplayers order to match the layer move spesified in the event, also handles markers layer that it would stay on top</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> MapMoveStartEvent </td><td> Stops internal timer scheduled to do a visibility check.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AfterMapMoveEvent </td><td> Schedules a visibility check to be done with a small delay (delay to improve performance on concurrent moves)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AfterMapLayerAddEvent </td><td> Checks if added layer has geometries. If not, checks if it has geometryWKT (well-known text) value. If WKT is available, parses it to fill in the geometry array.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Events the bundle sends out

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th> Event </th><th> When it is triggered/what it tells other components</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> MapLayerVisibilityChangedEvent </td><td> Notifies other bundles if a layer has become visible/invisible telling if its out of scale or content area.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Dependencies

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Dependency</th><th>Linked from</th><th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) </td>
    <td> not linked, assumes its linked by map </td>
    <td> Uses Openlayers to parse WKT geometry, detect if it matches to current maps viewport and to get the centerpoint for layers geometry. Also controls Openlayers to show/hide layers.</td>
  </tr>
