# Feature Selector

## Description

Bundle adds a grid to display features fetched via WFS or some other protocol supported by OpenLayers. Users can then view the features and edit them.

Features get added to the grid when the user clicks on the map. Alt key can be used to draw a rectangle which selects all features intersecting with the box and control key can be used to select multiple features and toggling selected features.

The bundle includes its own version of VectorLayerPlugin, which adds two OpenLayers controls to the map: SelectFeature and GetFeature. SelectFeature control is responsible for highlighting features on the map whereas GetFeature control fetches the features from the backend. It is currently tested only with GeoServer and WFS protocol. If requesting features via WFS the usual Cross-Origin policy of browser applies, so a proxy might be necessary.

## Bundle configuration

```javascript
"conf": {
  "queryUrl": "<url for WFS/other feature service (this is needed by DigiroadVectorLayerPlugin)>",
  "targetLayers": {
      "<layer id of a WMS layer>": {
          "objectId": "<the id field of the features>",
          "geometryName": "<geometry name of the features (optional, defaults to 'the_geom')>",
          "headers": [{
              "id": "<unique id used by the grid>",
              "name": "<name to display to users>",
              "field": "<corresponding field of a feature>",
              "editor": "<'integer', 'text' or 'select' (optional, if not specified, the data field is not editable)>"
          }],
          "protocolType": "<the type of the protocol used to fetch the features (optional, defaults to 'WFS')>",
          "protocolOpts": "<options for the protocol (optional, by default uses what it can get from the WMS layer, like featureType)>"
      }
  }
}

## Events the bundle listens to

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Event</th><th>How does the bundle react</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AfterMapLayerAddEvent</td><td>If the layer is a WMS layer and it has been defined in config (in targetLayers), it creates a grid to the flyout. It also creates a vector layer (for adding features on the layer) and adds it to the map.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AfterMapLayerRemoveEvent</td><td>Removes all the features bound to the layer and removes the grid from the flyout. Also destroys the created vector layer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FeatureSelector.FeaturesAddedEvent</td><td>Adds the features sent by the event to the grid and binds a hover event to them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FeatureSelector.FeaturesRemovedEvent</td><td>Removes the features sent by the event from the grid.</td>
  </tr>

## Events the bundle sends out

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Event</th><th>Why/when</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FeatureSelector.FeaturesAddedEvent</td><td>DigiroadVectorLayerPlugin sends this event when the user clicks on the map to select features.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FeatureSelector.FeaturesRemovedEvent</td><td>DigiroadVectorLayerPlugin sends this event when the user clicks on an empty spot on the map or uses the control key on a feature which has been selected already (toggle).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FeatureSelector.FeatureHighlightEvent</td><td>Upon moving the mouse cursor over a feature in the grid this event gets sent. It has a type which can be either 'highlight' or 'unHighlight'.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FeatureSelector.FeatureEditedEvent</td><td>Triggered when the user double clicks a cell in the grid, enter a new value and presses enter.</td>
